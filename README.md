Old project to aid in configuring SE Linux - not active

This was a project for a Linux scripting class years ago. I wrote it as an aid to setting up SE Linux on RHEL/CENTOS 5/6. I worked well
enough then but it got really freaking long and I doubt it works anymore. There are some cool fragments in there.
